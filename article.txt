In my first 20 years, I often wondered: What am I studying for? It was not until the end of the college entrance examination that I met my lifelong friend the art of light and shadow.
First of all, due to reality, photography can solely be a hobby for me, rather than a lifelong hobby.In addition, I became a would-be programmer who worked with code all day. It was not until I met photography again in the elective course that I was inspired by it. I couldn't help asking, why can't they be combined since they are both creating things? Here's what I said about that flash of insight.
As Heidegger said, "We should dwell poetically on the earth". First, art can expand our creative thinking, and programmers shouldn't be the stereotype of everyone's stereotype.Secondly I should touch on that it can also expand our knowledge and cultivate our hobbies. Last but not least, in order to enrich our college life, it should not only be busy and boring, but also elegant.
